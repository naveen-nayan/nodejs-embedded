# How Zenatix help people reduce energy wastage and make energy efficiency

Zenatix has developed an innovative product called WattMan. It’s an IoT based Building Management System (BMS) tailor-made for retail chains and banking set-ups that helps them in reducing their electricity consumption by up to 30 per cent.
Zenatix Solutions is a data-driven energy efficiency company that uses IoT and advanced machine learning based models to save up to 30 per cent energy for large commercial consumers of electricity like retail chains and banking set-ups.

## What energy-efficient model has Zenatix build?
Hardware products designed by Zenatix, together with innovations on the IoT stack (managing billions of data points) and analytics specific to the application vertical (one such vertical is energy and electrical asset management that we currently focus on) allow us to innovate such that a significant value add is delivered through customised solutions that are low on hardware and exploit advanced machine learning algorithms on the collected data.

## IoT based WattMan?
Energy efficiency is a critical element for sustainability and a lot of work is being done in this domain. Energy efficiency, delivered in different ways, is the least expensive source of power compared to any other source of energy. However, so far, much of the focus in energy efficiency has been on retrofits (build and deploy more energy efficient light bulbs, air conditioners, etc.). Often overlooked is the power of data driven energy efficiency – no matter whether you have an efficient or inefficient infrastructure, if you are not operating it well, you will bleed on energy.
Zenatix has developed an innovative product called WattMan. It’s an IoT based Building Management System (BMS) tailor-made for retail chains (essentially, anyone who has large number of geographically distributed infrastructure) that helps them in reducing their electricity consumption by up to 30 per cent. Given the distributed nature of retail/ banking set-ups (multiple outlets/ branches spread across the country), having control over the electricity spends and providing the right customer experience at the same time is a big challenge. 
WattMan addresses these challenges in an automated manner by delivering intelligent controls together with predictive and preventive maintenance. All this is powered by advanced machine learning algorithms. It employs our proprietary firmware for performing automatic sensing and control. Collected data is used to develop machine learning driven models deciding optimal operational settings based on external factors like weather and footfall, thus allowing sophisticated control.
What kind of case studies do you undertake?

## What kind of case wattman studies?
For a typical retail customer with 100s or 1000s of locations, we start with a paid pilot for 6-12 months at a small number of locations (5-10). 
Since the business model does not involve any capital expenditure as the customer pays an annual subscription fee, this is a low enough investment which is easy to get through. 
Thereafter, we develop a baseline consumption pattern (whereby we are just collecting data and not taking any control action) at the pilot locations and compare that baseline with WattMan starts taking control of their assets. 
Energy savings and other benefits are then proven to build a business case which is then internally taken up by a customer to scale from pilot locations to 100s of locations.

Wattman used to sense differnt parametes like energy, temperature, Ground voltage, UPS battery voltage, DVR+ Camera Health, Weather API
and with the help of differnet logic based on data, it controls ACs, Exhaust, ATM using relay and contractor it also provide a dashboard 
where all used case and data can be seen and changed to users.
